    <h2>Greek Life</h2>
    <p> Firstly, don't believe what the movies tell you. Whilst being part of a
      sorority does mean that there is the chance to go to parties, and yes each sorority does have a mansion that all the
      girls live in, it isn't all red cups and sleepovers. They care that you are enjoying college,
      but more importantly that you are succeeding academically. It's a commitment to be a part of a community
      that puts on charity events, supports each other and but also smashes their exams.

    <h2>Sport</h2>
    <p>In the US, the support for college sports teams is incredible! Basketball
    and American Football are the most popular sports and there is an
    amazing atmosphere and sense of pride on campus following a big win.
    Rivalry can get intense, and many of the games are streamed live on TV to
    rally national support, but experiencing it first hand in the sports arenas
    is a must!

    <h2>Academics</h2>
    <p>One of the hardest obstacles we had to overcome was to adjust to the
      American academic system. The methods of teaching and assessment are very
      different to those at a British university, with 17 week terms and weekly exams.
