    <h2>Movies Are Unrealistic</h2>
    <p>Take everything you have seen from the movies with a grain of salt. Some things are really similar - yes at parties there are red cups everywhere and the American Football really is as big as it seems.
      However you are still at university and if your grades count for your degree like ours did you have to find a way to balance the temptation to party your days away like in bad neighbour while actually going to class and getting a degree.

    <h2>Get Involved</h2>
    <p>In our opinion the best way to make friends and fully integrate into life at your new university is to join as many organisations as possible.
      Alongside greek life (which we would highly reccomend) we found some really cool clubs which they don't offer at our university back home.
      They provided many great opportunities for us to develop skills and take on leadership positions- this also adds to your CV when applying for jobs later on as they are a great talking point.

    <h2>People Are Interested</h2>
    <p>Something we didn't really anticipate was how much people would be interested in us because we were different.
    This may not be as common at universities where there is a higher international population but at our school
    with there being less than 10 British students people were definitly interested in our accents and background.
    This is can be flattering but overwhelming at first... but you get used to it as the year goes on.
    Try not to be insulted by it as in most cases people are just curious rather than making fun of you.
    Just take this into account around non-international friends as if this is the focus of conversation all the time it can get old very fast!

    <h2>Save Money Before and Part Time Work</h2>
    <p>The part nobody really tells you is how much money it will cost to spend the year abroad.
      While you save on tuition fees for the year living costs are generally more expensive and the exchange rate can work in your favour (or against in our case as we went just after Brexit!).
      Plan for this in advance! Save up as much money before you go so you have the funds to not worry about it when you are out there and can get as much out of your experience.
      We also got part time jobs to help fund our starbucks addictions and have extra money for travel.</p>

    <h2>Travel As Much As Possible</h2>
    <p>We went to a university which was two hours away from chicago kind of in the middle of nowhere.
      This made it difficult for us to travel on the weekends while balancing school work.
      The transportation links (especially) if you are not on the East Coast are not amazing making it difficult to get around.
      We took advantage of long weekends and trips through through greek life and on campus organisations to travel to different cities throughout the term.
      At the end of the school year, you have an additional 30 days allowed on your visa- making it the perfect time to go on a long trip. We did the whole of the East Coast from Orlando to Boston.
