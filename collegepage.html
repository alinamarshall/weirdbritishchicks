        <h2>Greek Life</h2>
    <p>Sorority and fraternity life was a big part of making our year so
    enjoyable! Despite the stereotypes that the movies portray, being part of
    a sorority is a unique experience and gave us the opportunity to make a wide circle of friends. There are many different
    sororities on campus, all of which carry different values, and cater to
    different personalities, however they all work hard to encourage their
    members to succeed socially and academically.</p>

       <h2>Sports</h2>
    <p> In the US, the support for college sports teams is incredible! Basketball
    and American Football are the most popular sports and there is an
    amazing atmosphere and sense of pride on campus following a big win.
    Rivalry can get intense, and many of the games are streamed live on TV to
    rally national support, but experiencing it first hand in the sports arenas
    is a must! </p>

   <h2>Academics</h2>
   <p>One of the hardest obstacles we had to overcome was to adjust to the
     American academic system. The methods of teaching and assessment are very
     different to those at a British university, with 17 week terms and weekly exams.</h2>
