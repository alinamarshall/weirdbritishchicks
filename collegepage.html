  <h1>Life as American college students</h1>
  <p> During our time in the US, we emersed ourselves in many aspects of
  college life... </p>

        <h2>Greek Life</h2>
    <p> Firstly, don't believe what the movies tell you. Whilst being part of a
      sorority does mean that there is the chance to go to parties, and yes each
      sorority does have a mansion that all the girls live in, it isn't all red cups and sleepovers.
      They care that you are enjoying college, but more importantly that you are
      succeeding academically. It's a commitment to be a part of a community that
      puts on charity events, supports each other and but also smashes their exams. </p>

       <h2>Sports</h2>
    <p> When it comes to college sport, the movies are actually right (kind of).
    Basketball and American Football are the most popular sports and the support from students is amazing. We are talking
    clothes, hats, car bumper stickers, baby grows, dog coats all supporting a college team.
    The marching band is real, the chants are real (yes are we're talking wildcats-high-school-musical kind of chants),
    and the genuine pride for a sports teams is very real.

   <h2>Academics</h2>
   <p>The hardest thing BY FAR was getting those grades. The American academic system is very different to what we were used to
     with only 2 semesters made up of 17 difficult weeks of exams, essays and compulsory lectures. As the year counted for
   50% of our degree, we had to work a lot harder and honestly it was a shock. We didn't think academics would be an issue,
   but after a while we got the hang of the constant assessments and 8am lectures and we've come out the otherside with a much
   better work ethic than before. </h2>

   <div class="column2">
  <h2>Societies</h2>
  <p>If being part of a sorority, dealing with being on the other side of the world, and struggling to achieve academically wasn't enough,
  we also joined a number of societies whilst in America (we are crazy, we know). From being on the exec of a society, to volunteering in
  the local community, getting that balance between work and play was very important to make sure we made the most of our year
  broad. It also helped us massively when applying for jobs and there were plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus.</p>
