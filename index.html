    <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
    <p>Our names are Isha and Alina and we spent the last year studying abroad in the United States on an exchange programme through our university.
      We spent the year at Purdue University in Indiana studying Business Analytics & Consultancy and Politics, Philosphy and Economics.
      Having returned from our crazy wirlwind of a year abroad we decided to make a guide to help other student planning on going to the states in the future.
      There are so many things we wish we knew beforehand so hopefully this can help you to learn from our experiences so you can hit the ground running and have an amazing time.

  <h2>How Did The Weird British Chicks Come About?</h2>
  <p>Despite going to the same university and living in the same college we were aquaintances at best before the year began.
    We quickly realised that having a friend going through the exact same things as you becomes a really helpful resource and we quickly became best friends.
    One day in the library (procrastinating in typical university student style) we had the idea of creating a joint instagram account.
    As there were very few British students at our university and American's have a love for British accents we quickly became known as the two british girls ... hence the name 'the weird british chicks' came about.
